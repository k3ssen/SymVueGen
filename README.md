# SymVue

Example project setup where Symfony and Vuetify are used. This setup shows how Twig and Vue can be integrated 
by loading Twig's rendered content inside a dynamic vue-component, enabling it to interact with the vue instance.

### Getting started

1) `yarn setup`  
(shorthand for `composer install && yarn install && yarn build`)
2) `yarn start` (for development)  
(shorthand for `symfony server:start -d && yarn watch`)
